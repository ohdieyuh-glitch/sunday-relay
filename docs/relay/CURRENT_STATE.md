# Sunday Relay — Current State

> The single source of truth for where Relay stands. Update at every phase
> boundary. Last updated: **2026-07-21 22:17 UTC** (Prompt 2 complete —

> machine implemented and verified; see SESSION_LOG.md for exact results).

## Phase

**Prompt 2 — Protocol and State Machine: COMPLETE** (2026-07-21 22:17 UTC).
Implemented: `relay.protocol.v1` (versioned envelopes for commands /
reports / events / queries, branded ids, enums, structured errors, strict
hand-rolled runtime validation with hidden-reasoning rejection); the
Prompt-2 contract set (RelayProject/Run/Task, TaskAssignment, File/Resource
claims, Blueprint, AgentHandoffPackage + CompilationRecord +
RevisionContract, Evidence Record/Bundle, VerificationRecord,
CompletionPolicy, ReviewerVerdict, Failure/Decision/Approval/OpenQuestion/
Usage records, FinalAuditReport, Checkpoint + budget/loop/permission policy
shapes; DisagreementRecord schema-only; ProjectRequirement/
ArchitectureRecord interface-only per PROTOCOL §6); the deterministic
RelayRun status×phase machine (centralized `transitionRun`: golden path,
one-revision path, 15-condition checkpoint escalation, honest-failure stop,
terminal protection, completion guard requiring Relay-produced passing
verification + independent approval); RelayTask transition validation with
owner/evidence/finding invariants, staleness + decision-invalidation
primitives, lease-expiry recovery; the append-only ledger foundation
(gap-free monotonic sequences, frozen envelopes, idempotency, deterministic
replay projection, claim record/promote/reject with exactly-once
promotion); storage ports + volatile test-only in-memory adapters (explicit
`acknowledgeVolatile` guard); deterministic test factories.
**Not implemented (by design):** CLI, adapters, simulation workflow,
handoff-compiler behavior, coordination wiring, persistence, UI.

**Prior phase — Phase 1 Architecture Lock (complete, commit 59b14e8):**
founder decisions 1–10 encoded into this documentation set.

## Authoritative documents (docs/relay/)

| Document | Role |
| --- | --- |
| RELAY_MVP_SPEC.md | Product scope, five-system MVP, Guided Mode rules, July 24 demo definition |
| ARCHITECTURE.md | Placement, module boundaries, dependency direction, hybrid execution, diagrams |
| PROTOCOL.md | `relay.protocol.v1` contracts + Prompt-2/deferred markings |
| SECURITY_BOUNDARIES.md | Trust boundaries, credentials, isolation, enforcement matrix, threats |
| TEST_STRATEGY.md | Planned tests per prompt + first deterministic demo scenarios |
| DECISIONS.md | ADR-001…020 + dependency analysis (zero dependencies added) |
| UI_VISION.md | Permanent visual direction (locked earlier, commit cec62dd) |
| SESSION_LOG.md | Append-only phase journal |

Superseded (historical, headers added): root `RELAY_STATUS.md`,
`RELAY_INTEGRATION.md`. AGENTS.md gained narrowly scoped §7 (Relay).

## Prototype status

The golden-path web app (`/relay.html`, `src/relay/**`) is the **Relay
Protocol Prototype**: preserved, committed, truthfully labeled; its pasted
evidence is classified `unverified claim`; it may be demoed only under the
prototype label. Its dogfood run (real independent review R1–R6 + real
repairs, commits 3277ffc/508fb92) remains a genuine artifact.

## Accepted founder decisions (2026-07-21)

1. Hybrid local/cloud execution; credential-free core; SpendAuthorizationPort
   + CloudDispatchGateway outside core; both budget layers must approve
   Aquala-funded calls.
2. Prompt Architect: simulated / imported (ChatGPT-authored, human-supervised)
   / live adapter later; no provider hardcoded; initial real workflow uses
   imported Blueprints.
3. Codex is the first live independent Reviewer; independence from
   assignment/session lineage; manual review labeled manual.
4. Guided Mode: max one automatic repair behind 15 deterministic conditions;
   otherwise checkpoint_required; never a second automatic repair.
5. Every control classified enforced / advisory / unsupported; matrix in
   SECURITY_BOUNDARIES.md; UIs display the true level.
6. July 24 demo = real Core + CLI on simulation adapters (no paid calls, no
   fake execution claims); prototype shown only as "Relay Protocol
   Prototype"; live Claude Code run is a safety-gated stretch goal.
7. Prototype preserved, not deleted; paste evidence = unverified claim.
8. Logical boundaries per ARCHITECTURE.md §1; directories under `src/relay/*`.
9. All clients consume the same Relay Core; no client-side workflow logic.
10. Stale docs superseded with headers; authoritative set under docs/relay/;
    narrow AGENTS.md Relay section added.

## Completed work

- Relay Protocol Prototype (2026-07-21 morning): domain, gate, store, web
  UI, 7 test files, dogfooded adversarial review + repairs. All green.
- UI vision locked (cec62dd).
- Pre-Phase-1 architecture analysis (accepted) + 3-lens adversarial critique.
- **This phase**: authoritative docs set written; supersession applied;
  AGENTS.md §7; verification run (see SESSION_LOG.md for exact results).

## Current work

None in flight — Phase 1 closes with this commit.

## Next prompt

**Prompt 3 — Task Ownership, Duplicate-Work Prevention, and Structured
Handoff Compiler**: wire relay-coordination's pre-execution battery
(duplicate/equivalent/completed/superseded task detection, file-claim
conflicts, stale context/base-revision/decision checks — the primitives
from Prompt 2 — into dispatch), lease bookkeeping over the stores, and
implement relay-handoff's compiler behavior: compile AgentHandoffPackage +
HandoffCompilationRecord from ledger refs at pinned versions, role-specific
package composition, Revision Contract compilation with real evaluation of
the 15 Guided-Mode conditions, CompletionPolicy evaluation (low-risk
preset), and relay-recovery's repeated-failure/no-progress detection
functions over FailureRecords. Tests per TEST_STRATEGY §§5–7. Still no
adapters, no CLI, no persistence, no UI, no paid calls.

Remaining carried-over Prompt-2 notes: budget stop-before-dispatch wiring
(TEST_STRATEGY §7) lands with the compiler/checkpoint work; CompletionPolicy
evaluation and FailureRecord detection functions were deferred to Prompt 3
with the compiler since they operate on compiled dispatches.

## Known blockers

None.

## Known risks

- July 24 is 3 days out: Prompts 2–4 (protocol/core → simulation harness →
  CLI) must land on schedule for the demo definition in RELAY_MVP_SPEC §8.
- The worktree-manager safety gate makes the live-Claude-Code stretch goal
  unlikely by the 24th — by design; do not weaken.
- Prototype relocation to `src/relay/prototype/` (with boundary-test
  rewrite) is deliberately deferred to a later prompt to keep this phase
  docs-only.

## Verification status

See SESSION_LOG.md entry 2026-07-21 (Phase 1) for the exact commands run
and results in this phase.

## Branch / worktree

`../sunday-relay` worktree, branch `feature/relay-yc-demo`. Phase 1 docs
commits: c0a959f (protocol+architecture), ccebea5 (spec+security), 36ebc0e
(tests+ADRs), b8359e2 (state/log/supersessions/AGENTS §7), then the final
audit-fix lock commit (`docs(relay): lock expanded Relay architecture` —
see `git log`).
